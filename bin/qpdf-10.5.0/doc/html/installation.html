<span id="installing"></span><h1>Building and Installing QPDF<a class="headerlink" href="#building-and-installing-qpdf" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes how to build and install qpdf. Please see also
the <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> and
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INSTALL</span></code> files in the source distribution.</p>
<section id="system-requirements">
<span id="prerequisites"></span><h2>System Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#system-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The qpdf package has few external dependencies. In order to build qpdf,
the following packages are required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A C++ compiler that supports C++-14.</p></li>
<li><p>zlib: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zlib.net/">http://www.zlib.net/</a></p></li>
<li><p>jpeg: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ijg.org/files/">http://www.ijg.org/files/</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://libjpeg-turbo.org/">https://libjpeg-turbo.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Recommended but not required:</em> gnutls: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnutls.org/">https://www.gnutls.org/</a> to be
able to use the gnutls crypto provider, and/or openssl:
<a class="reference external" href="https://openssl.org/">https://openssl.org/</a> to be able to use the openssl crypto provider.</p></li>
<li><p>gnu make 3.81 or newer: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make">http://www.gnu.org/software/make</a></p></li>
<li><p>perl version 5.8 or newer: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>; required for running
the test suite. Starting with qpdf version 9.1.1, perl is no longer
required at runtime.</p></li>
<li><p>GNU diffutils (any version): <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/">http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/</a>
is required to run the test suite. Note that this is the version of
diff present on virtually all GNU/Linux systems. This is required
because the test suite uses <strong class="command">diff -u</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Part of qpdf’s test suite does comparisons of the contents PDF files by
converting them images and comparing the images. The image comparison
tests are disabled by default. Those tests are not required for
determining correctness of a qpdf build if you have not modified the
code since the test suite also contains expected output files that are
compared literally. The image comparison tests provide an extra check to
make sure that any content transformations don’t break the rendering of
pages. Transformations that affect the content streams themselves are
off by default and are only provided to help developers look into the
contents of PDF files. If you are making deep changes to the library
that cause changes in the contents of the files that qpdf generate,
then you should enable the image comparison tests. Enable them by
running <strong class="command">configure</strong> with the
<code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-test-compare-images</span></code> flag. If you enable
this, the following additional requirements are required by the test
suite. Note that in no case are these items required to use qpdf.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>libtiff: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/">http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/</a></p></li>
<li><p>GhostScript version 8.60 or newer: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ghostscript.com">http://www.ghostscript.com</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not enable this, then you do not need to have tiff and
ghostscript.</p>

<section id="build-instructions">
<span id="building"></span><h2>Build Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#build-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Building qpdf on UNIX is generally just a matter of running</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./configure
make
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can also run <strong class="command">make check</strong> to run the test
suite and <strong class="command">make install</strong> to install. Please run
<strong class="command">./configure --help</strong> for options on what can be
configured. You can also set the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DESTDIR</span></code> during
installation to install to a temporary location, as is common with many
open source packages. Please see also the
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> and
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INSTALL</span></code> files in the source distribution.</p>
<p>Building on Windows is a little bit more complicated. For details,
please see <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README-windows.md</span></code> in the source
distribution. You can also download a binary distribution for Windows.
There is a port of qpdf to Visual C++ version 6 in the
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contrib</span></code> area generously contributed by Jian
Ma. This is also discussed in more detail in
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README-windows.md</span></code>.</p>
<p>While <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wchar_t</span></code> is part of the C++ standard, qpdf uses it in only one
place in the public API, and it’s just in a helper function. It is
possible to build qpdf on a system that doesn’t have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wchar_t</span></code>, and
it’s also possible to compile a program that uses qpdf on a system
without <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wchar_t</span></code> as long as you don’t call that one method. This is a
very unusual situation. For a detailed discussion, please see the
top-level README.md file in qpdf’s source distribution.</p>
<p>There are some other things you can do with the build. Although qpdf
uses <strong class="command">autoconf</strong>, it does not use
<strong class="command">automake</strong> but instead uses a
hand-crafted non-recursive Makefile that requires gnu make. If you’re
really interested, please read the comments in the top-level
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>.</p>

<section id="building-documentation">
<span id="build-doc"></span><h2>Building Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#building-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The qpdf manual is written in reStructured Text and built with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> using the <a class="reference external" href="https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io">Read the Docs Sphinx Theme</a>. In order to build the
HTML documentation from source, you need to install sphinx and the
theme, which you can typically do with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">sphinx</span>
<span class="pre">sphinx_rtd_theme</span></code>. To build the PDF version of the documentation, you
need <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdflatex</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">latexmk</span></code>, and a fairly complete LaTeX
installation. Detailed requirements can be found in the Sphinx
documentation. To see how the documentation is built for the qpdf
distribution, refer to the <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build-scripts/build-doc</span></code> file in the
qpdf source distribution.</p>

<section id="crypto-providers">
<span id="crypto"></span><h2>Crypto Providers<a class="headerlink" href="#crypto-providers" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Starting with qpdf 9.1.0, the qpdf library can be built with multiple
implementations of providers of cryptographic functions, which we refer
to as “crypto providers.” At the time of writing, a crypto
implementation must provide MD5 and SHA2 (256, 384, and 512-bit) hashes
and RC4 and AES256 with and without CBC encryption. In the future, if
digital signature is added to qpdf, there may be additional requirements
beyond this.</p>
<p>Starting with qpdf version 9.1.0, the available implementations are
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">native</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gnutls</span></code>. In qpdf 10.0.0, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">openssl</span></code> was added.
Additional implementations may be added if needed. It is also possible
for a developer to provide their own implementation without modifying
the qpdf library.</p>
<section id="build-support-for-crypto-providers">
<span id="crypto-build"></span><h3>Build Support For Crypto Providers<a class="headerlink" href="#build-support-for-crypto-providers" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>When building with qpdf’s build system, crypto providers can be enabled
at build time using various <strong class="command">./configure</strong>
options. The default behavior is for
<strong class="command">./configure</strong> to discover which crypto providers
can be supported based on available external libraries, to build all
available crypto providers, and to use an external provider as the
default over the native one. This behavior can be changed with the
following flags to <strong class="command">./configure</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-crypto-</span><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code>
(where <code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code> is a supported crypto
provider): enable the <code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code> crypto
provider, requiring any external dependencies it needs</p></li>
<li><p><code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--disable-crypto-</span><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code>:
disable the <code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code> provider, and do not
link against its dependencies even if they are available</p></li>
<li><p><code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--with-default-crypto=</span><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code>:
make <code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code> the default provider even if
a higher priority one is available</p></li>
<li><p><code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--disable-implicit-crypto</span></code>: only build crypto
providers that are explicitly requested with an
<code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-crypto-</span><em><span class="pre">x</span></em></code>
option</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you want to guarantee that the gnutls crypto provider is
used and that the native provider is not built, you could run
<strong class="command">./configure --enable-crypto-gnutls
--disable-implicit-crypto</strong>.</p>
<p>If you build qpdf using your own build system, in order for qpdf to work
at all, you need to enable at least one crypto provider. The file
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libqpdf/qpdf/qpdf-config.h.in</span></code> provides
macros <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEFAULT_CRYPTO</span></code>, whose value must be a string naming the
default crypto provider, and various symbols starting with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USE_CRYPTO_</span></code>, at least one of which has to be enabled. Additionally,
you must compile the source files that implement a crypto provider. To
get a list of those files, look at
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libqpdf/build.mk</span></code>. If you want to omit a
particular crypto provider, as long as its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USE_CRYPTO_</span></code> symbol is
undefined, you can completely ignore the source files that belong to a
particular crypto provider. Additionally, crypto providers may have
their own external dependencies that can be omitted if the crypto
provider is not used. For example, if you are building qpdf yourself and
are using an environment that does not support gnutls or openssl, you
can ensure that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USE_CRYPTO_NATIVE</span></code> is defined, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USE_CRYPTO_GNUTLS</span></code>
is not defined, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEFAULT_CRYPTO</span></code> is defined to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;native&quot;</span></code>. Then
you must include the source files used in the native implementation,
some of which were added or renamed from earlier versions, to your
build, and you can ignore
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCrypto_gnutls.cc</span></code>. Always consult
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libqpdf/build.mk</span></code> to get the list of source
files you need to build.</p>

<section id="runtime-crypto-provider-selection">
<span id="crypto-runtime"></span><h3>Runtime Crypto Provider Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-crypto-provider-selection" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>You can use the <code class="samp docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--show-crypto</span></code> option to
<strong class="command">qpdf</strong> to get a list of available crypto
providers. The default provider is always listed first, and the rest are
listed in lexical order. Each crypto provider is listed on a line by
itself with no other text, enabling the output of this command to be
used easily in scripts.</p>
<p>You can override which crypto provider is used by setting the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDF_CRYPTO_PROVIDER</span></code> environment variable. There are few reasons to
ever do this, but you might want to do it if you were explicitly trying
to compare behavior of two different crypto providers while testing
performance or reproducing a bug. It could also be useful for people who
are implementing their own crypto providers.</p>

<p>If you are writing code that uses libqpdf and you want to force a
certain crypto provider to be used, you can call the method
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider::setDefaultProvider</span></code>. The argument is the name of
a built-in or developer-supplied provider. To add your own crypto
provider, you have to create a class derived from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoImpl</span></code> and
register it with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider</span></code>. For additional information, see

<section id="crypto-provider-design-notes">
<span id="crypto-design"></span><h3>Crypto Provider Design Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#crypto-provider-design-notes" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This section describes a few bits of rationale for why the crypto
provider interface was set up the way it was. You don’t need to know any
of this information, but it’s provided for the record and in case it’s
interesting.</p>
<p>As a general rule, I want to avoid as much as possible including large
blocks of code that are conditionally compiled such that, in most
builds, some code is never built. This is dangerous because it makes it
very easy for invalid code to creep in unnoticed. As such, I want it to
be possible to build qpdf with all available crypto providers, and this
is the way I build qpdf for local development. At the same time, if a
particular packager feels that it is a security liability for qpdf to
use crypto functionality from other than a library that gets
considerable scrutiny for this specific purpose (such as gnutls,
openssl, or nettle), then I want to give that packager the ability to
completely disable qpdf’s native implementation. Or if someone wants to
avoid adding a dependency on one of the external crypto providers, I
don’t want the availability of the provider to impose additional
external dependencies within that environment. Both of these are
situations that I know to be true for some users of qpdf.</p>
<p>I want registration and selection of crypto providers to be thread-safe,
and I want it to work deterministically for a developer to provide their
own crypto provider and be able to set it up as the default. This was
the primary motivation behind requiring C++-11 as doing so enabled me to
exploit the guaranteed thread safety of local block static
initialization. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider</span></code> class uses a singleton
pattern with thread-safe initialization to create the singleton instance
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider</span></code> and exposes only static methods in its public
interface. In this way, if a developer wants to call any
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider</span></code> methods, the library guarantees the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider</span></code> is fully initialized and all built-in crypto
providers are registered. Making <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDFCryptoProvider</span></code> actually know
about all the built-in providers may seem a bit sad at first, but this
choice makes it extremely clear exactly what the initialization behavior
is. There’s no question about provider implementations automatically
registering themselves in a nondeterministic order. It also means that
implementations do not need to know anything about the provider
interface, which makes them easier to test in isolation. Another
advantage of this approach is that a developer who wants to develop
their own crypto provider can do so in complete isolation from the qpdf
library and, with just two calls, can make qpdf use their provider in
their application. If they decided to contribute their code, plugging it
into the qpdf library would require a very small change to qpdf’s source
code.</p>
<p>The decision to make the crypto provider selectable at runtime was one I
struggled with a little, but I decided to do it for various reasons.
Allowing an end user to switch crypto providers easily could be very
useful for reproducing a potential bug. If a user reports a bug that
some cryptographic thing is broken, I can easily ask that person to try
with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QPDF_CRYPTO_PROVIDER</span></code> variable set to different values. The
same could apply in the event of a performance problem. This also makes
it easier for qpdf’s own test suite to exercise code with different
providers without having to make every program that links with qpdf
aware of the possibility of multiple providers. In qpdf’s continuous
integration environment, the entire test suite is run for each supported
crypto provider. This is made simple by being able to select the
provider using an environment variable.</p>
<p>Finally, making crypto providers selectable in this way establish a
pattern that I may follow again in the future for stream filter
providers. One could imagine a future enhancement where someone could
provide their own implementations for basic filters like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FlateDecode</span></code> or for other filters that qpdf doesn’t support.
Implementing the registration functions and internal storage of
registered providers was also easier using C++-11’s functional
interfaces, which was another reason to require C++-11 at this time.</p>
